// first program in c++


#include<iostream>
using namespace std
int main()
{
    cout<<"hello world";
    return 0;

}


output:hello world

// cout is used for printing on console

//C++ offers various headers, each of which contains information needed for programs to work properly.
This particular program calls for the header <iostream>.
The number sign (#) at the beginning of a line targets the compiler's pre-processor. 
In this case, #include tells the pre-processor to include the <iostream> header.
The <iostream> header defines the standard stream objects that input and output data.//
