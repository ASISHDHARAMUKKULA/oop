Addition Operation


//The addition operator adds its operands together.
int x = 40 + 60;
cout << x;

// Outputs 100

Subtraction Operation


//The subtraction operator subtracts one operand from the other.
int x = 100 - 60;
cout << x;

//Outputs 40

Multiplication Operation


//The multiplication operator multiplies its operands.

int x = 5 * 6;
cout << x;

//Outputs 30


Division Operation


//The division operator divides the first operand by the second.
//Any remainder is dropped in order to return an integer value.


int x = 10 / 3;
cout << x;

// Outputs 3


Modular Division

//The modulus operator (%) is informally known as the remainder operator because it returns the remainder after an integer division.



int x = 25 % 7;
cout << x;

// Outputs 4
